Module: Learn the AL statements in Dynamics 365 Business Central

You can comment by using two forward slashes (//)
// This is a comment

/* This is a comment
   on multiple
   multiple
   multiple
   lines. */

In Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can add documentation to your code by including XML elements
in special comment fields directly in the source code before the block of code that the comment refers to.
By adding XML comments in code, you can improve readability, add useful information about the implementation,
and help others take over code that you wrote.

/// <summary>
/// Provides functionality to create and send e-mails.
/// </summary>

codeunit 8901 "Email"
{
    Access = Public;

    /// <summary>
    /// Enqueues an email in the outbox to be sent in the background.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="EmailMessageId">The ID of the email to enqueue</param>
    procedure Enqueue(EmailMessageId: Guid)
    begin
        EmailImpl.Enqueue(EmailMessageId);
    end;
...

if statements

var 
    a: Integer;
    b: Integer;
    c: Integer;
begin
    a := 10;
    b := 5;

    if a > b then
        c := a - b;
end;

If you want to run multiple statements when the condition is true,
you need to use a compound statement, as shown in the following example.

var
    a: Integer;
    b: Integer;
    c: Integer;
begin
    a := 10;
    b := 5;

    if a > b then begin
        c := a - b;
        Message('%1', c);
    end;
end;

Case statements(switchcase)

var
    a: Integer;
begin
    case "Document Type" of
        "Document Type"::Quote:
            a := 1 + 1;
        "Document Type"::Order:
            a := 2 + 1;
        "Document Type"::Invoice:
            begin
                // Some statement 1;
                // Some statement 2;
                // Some statement 3;
                a := 3 + 1;
            end;
        "Document Type"::"Return Order":
            if Reason = Reason::Return then begin
                // Some statement 1;
                // Some statement 2;
                // Some statement 3;
                a := 4 + 1;                
            end;
        else
            a := 5 + 1;
    end;

end;

Use repetitive statements

You can use repetitive statements when you want to repeat the implementation of one or more statements. The five different types of repetitive statements that you can use are:

for-to-do

for-downto-do

foreach-in-do

while-do

repeat-until

For loop:

var
    intCount: Integer;
    total: Integer;
begin
    for intCount := 1 to 5 do
        total := total + 3;
end;
