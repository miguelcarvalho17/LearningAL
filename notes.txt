Module: Introduction to the basics of AL programming in Dynamics 365 Business Central

Object Types in AL:
-Table
-Page
-CodeUnit
-Report

Event Triggers:
Always start with On
-OnInsert()
-OnModidy()
-OnDelete()

Variables must contain PascalCase notation, start every word with uppercase letter. 
Example: Variable for a customer's name -> CustomerName

var CustomerName: Text[50];

It's now possible to add multiple variable declarations of the same type in a singular line.

var
        myInt, nextInt, thirdInt : Integer;
        isValid, doCheck : Boolean;

Protected variables - make variables accessible between tables and table extensions and between pages and page extensions.

The Option data type is a zero-based enumerator type; therefore, you can convert option values to integers.
var 
        Color : Option Red, Green, Blue;
Color := Color::Red

Better to use Enum because you can use an Enum object in every other object without the need to redefine it.

Work with collections - Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries

In AL, you start counting at one (1) for an array, while other programming languages,
like Java, C#, and so on, usually start counting at zero (0) for the first element of an array.

Create and access arrays:
SalesAmount: array[10] of Integer;
SalesAmount[5] := 0;
MultiDimension Array:
SalesAmount: array[6,9] of Integer;
SalesAmount[2][1] := 2;

A List data type doesn't require you to define how many elements you want to store up front (while an Array data type does).

Create and access Lists:
CustomerNames: List of [Text];
CustomerNames.Add("Paul");
CustomerNames.Add("Linda");
CustomerNames.Get(1);   //returns Paul

Dictionary represents a collection of keys and values.
CountriesDictionary: Dictionary of [Code[20], List of [Text]];

Operators 
5 / 2 = 2,5     //Division
5 DIV 2 = 2     //Integer divide
5 MOD 2 = 1     //Remainder of division

Relational expressions:
<> (not equal to)
IN (include in set)
